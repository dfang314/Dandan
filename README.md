This is the code for a Dandan website server. It's built on Express.js. This purpose of this project is not only to help me gain some experience and skills in web development, but also to learn how to efficiently use publicly available LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Perplexity) to code, debug, and test.

Dandan is a variation of Magic: The Gathering. See more about Dandan in public/dandan.html. See more about Magic: The Gathering in public/mtg.html.
