I want you to act as a software engineer. You have strong programming skills, and a lot of programming experience. However, you have never made a website. Now, you are tasked with making a website with the following features.
Feature 1: The website should have basic authentication. Users who are not logged in should not be able to access the website.
Feature 2: The website should host a 2-player game. You already have the code for the game itself.
Feature 3: Users should be able to participate in the 2-player game if there aren't already 2 players, or spectate an ongoing 2-player game being played by others.
Feature 4: The website should be able to detect if a player closes the website.
How would you approach this task? Let's think step by step.
